# Next.ID Community Governance

Welcome to [Next.ID](http://Next.ID) community! We must accomplish many efforts before it becomes a universal DID infrastructure for everyone. Thus a good structure of governance is strongly required.

All governance history is not only recorded here on GitHub but also totally open to the public on [this Notion org](https://www.notion.so/Next-ID-Home-0fb4ba9200d6458ab6c4fa81778f6a7b). You’ll have to be at least a Delegation Role of Builder to be a member of that notion.

In the journey towards it, we invite you to become a community member to do whatever part you like. 

For now, the community holds mainly five SIGs(Special Interest Group): Development, Product, Developer Advocate, Marketing, and Community.

And there’re three types of Delegation Roles:

| Delegation Role | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Builder | - Specializing on one focus or more |
| Sig-owner | - POC(point of contact) of one focus or more, to coordinate Builder within the scope or cross-functionally |
| Maintainer | - initiator of the community, steward the project towards massive adoption |

## Retirement of Delegation Role

If one delegation role doesn’t appear in a single activity of any community’s event for more than half a year, this member will automatically be removed from the Community Membership.

## **The Incentive System (TBD)**

As an open-source Web3 DID protocol, we are currently in the early stages of our project development. Our long-term vision includes the establishment of a DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) to manage and operate the project. To that end, we plan to release a series of community funds and a DAO whitepaper starting in Q4 of 2023.

In anticipation of these developments, we have launched [Next.ID Planet,](https://medium.com/@Next.ID/next-planet-7e7c87687224) a platform that records the contributions and interactions of our community members with the Next.ID ecosystem. These records will serve as one of the bases for future airdrops and community retrospective rewards.

### **Key Milestones:**

- **Q4 2023**: Release of community funds and DAO whitepaper.

### **Contribution Tracking:**

- **Next.ID Planet**: A dedicated platform to track community contributions and interactions, which will be considered for future rewards.

### **Reward Mechanisms:**

- **Airdrops**: Community members who have shown significant contributions may be eligible for airdrops as part of our incentive program.
- **Community Retrospective Rewards**: Periodic rewards will be given to active community members based on their contributions and engagement, as recorded on Next.ID Planet.

### **Eligibility:**

- All community members are eligible to participate in the incentive program, provided they meet certain criteria, which will be detailed in the forthcoming DAO whitepaper.

### **Transparency:**

- All records of contributions and rewards will be transparent and publicly accessible, aligning with our open-source ethos.

By engaging with the Next.ID community, you're not just contributing to the evolution of a pioneering Web3 DID protocol; you also have the opportunity to benefit from a range of incentive mechanisms as the project matures.
