# Next.ID Community Governance

Welcome to [Next.ID](http://Next.ID) community! We must accomplish many efforts before it becomes a universal DID infrastructure for everyone. Thus a good structure of governance is strongly required.

All governance history is not only recorded here on GitHub but also totally open to the public on [this Notion org](https://www.notion.so/Next-ID-Home-0fb4ba9200d6458ab6c4fa81778f6a7b). You’ll have to be at least a Delegation Role of Builder to be a member of that notion.

In the journey towards it, we invite you to become a community member to do whatever part you like. 

For now, the community holds mainly five SIGs(Special Interest Group): Development, Product, Developer Advocate, Marketing, and Community.

And there’re three types of Delegation Roles:

| Delegation Role | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Builder | - Specializing on one focus or more |
| Sig-owner | - POC(point of contact) of one focus or more, to coordinate Builder within the scope or cross-functionally |
| Maintainer | - initiator of the community, steward the project towards massive adoption |

## Delegation Role

    - Give it a public notice period for at least one week, and then merge
- Responsibility

## Retirement of Delegation Role

If one delegation role doesn’t appear in a single activity of any community’s event for more than half a year, this member will automatically be removed from the Community Membership.

## The Incentive System(TBD)

Early heads-up, Next.ID community serving a public good has no intention of becoming profitable. Take it as more like an NGO. The mechanism that makes it sustainable is more like a “gas fee” in ETH, which only provides the minimum funding. As for rewarding the builders of its way towards the public, SBT-ish none-transferrable NFT will be designed later on, and how many portions of it are linked to the gas fee will also be determined.
