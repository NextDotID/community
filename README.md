# **Next.ID Community Governance**

Welcome to the **[Next.ID](http://next.id/)** community! Our goal is to become a universal DID infrastructure accessible to everyone. To achieve this, a robust governance structure is essential.

Our governance history is fully transparent and recorded not only on GitHub but also on **[this Notion page](https://www.notion.so/Next-ID-Home-0fb4ba9200d6458ab6c4fa81778f6a7b?pvs=21)**. To be a member of this Notion organization, you must hold at least a "Builder" delegation role.

We invite you to join our community and contribute in any capacity that interests you.

Currently, our community is organized into five Special Interest Groups (SIGs): Development, Product, Developer Advocacy, Marketing, and Community.

We have three types of Delegation Roles:

| Delegation Role | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Builder | Specializes in one or more focus areas |
| Sig-owner | Acts as the point of contact for one or more focus areas, coordinating Builders either within a specific scope or cross-functionally |
| Maintainer | Initiates community activities and steers the project toward widespread adoption |

## **Retirement of Delegation Roles**

## **The Incentive System (TBD)**

As an open-source Web3 DID protocol, we are currently in the early stages of our project development. Our long-term vision includes the establishment of a DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) to manage and operate the project. To that end, we plan to release a series of community funds and a DAO whitepaper starting in Q4 of 2023.

In anticipation of these developments, we have launched [Next.ID Planet,](https://medium.com/@Next.ID/next-planet-7e7c87687224) a platform that records the contributions and interactions of our community members with the Next.ID ecosystem. These records will serve as one of the bases for future airdrops and community retrospective rewards.

### **Key Milestones:**

- **Q4 2023**: Release of community funds and DAO whitepaper.

### **Contribution Tracking:**

- **Next.ID Planet**: A dedicated platform to track community contributions and interactions, which will be considered for future rewards.

### **Reward Mechanisms:**

- **Airdrops**: Community members who have shown significant contributions may be eligible for airdrops as part of our incentive program.
- **Community Retrospective Rewards**: Periodic rewards will be given to active community members based on their contributions and engagement, as recorded on Next.ID Planet.

### **Eligibility:**

- All community members are eligible to participate in the incentive program, provided they meet certain criteria, which will be detailed in the forthcoming DAO whitepaper.

### **Transparency:**

- All records of contributions and rewards will be transparent and publicly accessible, aligning with our open-source ethos.

By engaging with the Next.ID community, you're not just contributing to the evolution of a pioneering Web3 DID protocol; you also have the opportunity to benefit from a range of incentive mechanisms as the project matures.
